# Jira to GPT-4o to Beautiful AI Integration - Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Jira to GPT-4o to Beautiful AI integration solution. The solution extracts data from Jira, processes it, stores it in a Weaviate vector database, generates insights using GPT-4o, creates PowerPoint presentations, and updates Beautiful AI presentations hourly.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Jira Data Extractor**: Extracts tickets, sprints, epics, and comments from Jira using the REST API
2. **Data Processor**: Cleans and processes the extracted data for analysis
3. **Weaviate Vector Database**: Stores the processed data in a vector database for semantic search
4. **GPT-4o Integration**: Generates business analyst-level insights from the Jira data
5. **PowerPoint Generator**: Creates PowerPoint presentations from the generated insights
6. **Beautiful AI Integration**: Updates Beautiful AI presentations with the latest insights hourly

The data flows through these components in the following sequence:
1. Jira data is extracted hourly
2. The data is processed and cleaned
3. The processed data is stored in Weaviate
4. GPT-4o queries Weaviate to generate insights
5. PowerPoint presentations are generated from the insights
6. Beautiful AI presentations are updated with the latest insights
